Kidney stone disease (nephrolithiasis) is a common problem amongst the western population. Most kidney stones are small and pass spontaneously. Some nephrolithiasis patients develop large stones, which can cause significant morbidity in the form of acute symptoms and chronic complications if they are not treated. Medical imaging technique plays a crucial role in identifying these stones. With the help of MRI, CT AND US imaging techniques the image of the kidney stone can be obtained. By applying various image processing techniques in the image obtained we can get the image of the kidney stone with better quality. Here the images obtained through the CT scan or US scan or MRI scan are going to be processed, enhanced and segmented to locate the exact position and to identify the number of stones. These images can be used for better treatment. Several techniques were developed to detect and analyze the kidney stone using several algorithms such as Watershed Algorithm, K-means clustering.
